The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and stylized using [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

## Running the application

Start by installing all necessary dependencies:

### `npm install`

To see the application running in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), run:

### `BEARER_TOKEN=<insert twitter bearer token> npm start`

This will start the Node application on port 5000 and the front-end will proxy the calls to work on port 3000.

## Running tests

To run the existing tests for the React application only, run:

### `npm test`

To run the existing tests for the Node backend + React, run:

### `npm run test-server`
